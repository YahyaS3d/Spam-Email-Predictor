## SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Its primary goal is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points from different classes with the maximum margin. This margin allows SVM to be robust to noise and generalize well to unseen data]
## Adaboost
adaBoost is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and iterative improvement of classification accuracy. The main goal of adaboost is to train a set of weak learners, such as short decision trees, and then combine them to create a robust model capable of high-accuracy classification.
